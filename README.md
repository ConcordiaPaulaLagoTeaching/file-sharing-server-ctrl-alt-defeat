# File Sharing System 

In this project, you will be developing a file-sharing server. A file share server is a computer or server that enables multiple users on a network to access and share files and folders in a central location. It allows users to access files on various devices. You will create a server file system simulator to store all the files created by clients. 


This repository contains two projects: the client and the server. You only need to modify the server. 



---------COMPILE AND RUN SERVER /CLIENT 

SPLIT TERMINALS AND CD TO FileServer and FileClient respectively

```
mkdir -p target/classes
find src/main/java -name "*.java" > sources.txt
javac -d target/classes @sources.txt
java -cp target/classes ca.concordia.Main

```
